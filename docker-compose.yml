  # The environment variable "TAG" is used throughout this file to
  # specify the version of the images to run. The default is set in the
  # '.env' file in this folder. It can be overridden with any normal
  # technique for setting environment variables, for example:
  #
  #   TAG=6.0.0-beta1 docker-compose up
  #
  # REF: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#variable-substitution
  #
  # Also be sure to set the ELASTIC_VERSION variable. For released versions,
  # ${TAG} and ${ELASTIC_VERSION} will be identical, but for pre-release
  # versions, ${TAG} might contain an extra build identifier, like
  # "6.0.0-beta1-3eab5b40", so a full invocation might look like:
  #
  #   ELASTIC_VERSION=6.0.0-beta1 TAG=6.0.0-beta1-3eab5b40 docker-compose up
